                    <p>I used to think friendship had to be loud. That the best ones were always filled with sleepovers, long phone calls, constant texts, and inside jokes shouted across classrooms. And for a while, it was like that. We were loud, everywhere, laughing in hallways, staying up too late, scribbling notes in class and folding them like origami secrets. It felt like nothing could ever change.</p>
                    
                    <p>But life doesn't always ask for our permission before it moves on. Schedules shifted. Messages came less often. Some responses came late. Some... didn't come at all. And for a moment, I thought maybe I'd lost something. Maybe friendship was supposed to expire quietly, like a forgotten to-do list or an unanswered letter.</p>
                    
                    <p>But then came the surprises — the kind that taught me what real friendship actually looks like.</p>

            <div class="content-box">

                <div class="text-column">
                    <p>A friend who remembered my favorite snack and brought it without asking. Another who sat in silence with me while I couldn't find the right words. Someone texting "I was thinking about you" just when I felt invisible. It was quieter than I expected. Gentler. Less about showing up all the time and more about showing up when it mattered.</p>

                    <p>I began to learn that friendship isn't always made of grand gestures. Sometimes it's built in the soft, small moments — in knowing glances, in the way someone saves you a seat, or in how they remember the version of you that even you sometimes forget.</p>

                    <p>I've lost friends I thought would stay forever. And found comfort in people I never expected to get close to. Some friends were just for a chapter. Others quietly stayed, without needing to be the loudest in the room. Friendship taught me that loyalty doesn't have to be loud. Love doesn't have to be announced. And real connection often arrives in the form of someone who doesn't need to fix you — just sit beside you, even in the messy parts.</p>

                    <p>It's not always exciting. Not always perfect. But it's real.</p>
